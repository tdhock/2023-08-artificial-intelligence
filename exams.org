Practice exam questions

1. We learned that an intelligent agent can be seen as being composed
   of four interacting components (PEAS). Name the four components and
   briefly describe what each does.

2. For each of the following three task environments, give the six
   attributes (observability, determinism, etc) with a brief
   justification for each. (a) Poker, (b) route finding, (c)
   chess.

3. Given the [[https://www.cefns.nau.edu/~edo/Classes/CS470-570_WWW/Assignments/Prog2-RoadwarriorSearch/Grading/small_tester.html][simple test map]] from the route-finding homework, assume
   we start at node F and want to get to node K. Give the order of the
   first 10 nodes expanded by (a) breadth first search, and (b) depth
   first search.  Break ties alphabetically (choose A before B, etc).

4. Draw a game tree with depth 3, where each node has two
   children. Assign these values from left to right in terminal nodes:
   10, 5, 2, 8, 2, 1, 9, 6. Assign values to each non-terminal node,
   assuming it is max's move. Working from left to right, write alpha
   and beta values on each node. Draw an X over nodes which are pruned
   using alpha-beta.

5. Same as 4 but assume it is min's move.

6. When using a matrix to represent machine learning inputs, what does
   each row and column represent, in the case of image classification?

7. When splitting data into train/test sets, what is the purpose of
   each set? When splitting a train set into subtrain/validation sets,
   what is the purpose of each set?

8. In order to determine if any non-trivial predictive relationship
   between inputs and output has been learned, a comparison with a
   featureless baseline that ignores the inputs must be used. In the
   case of image classification, how do you compute the featureless
   baseline predictions?
   
9. How can you tell if machine learning model predictions are
   underfitting or overfitting?

10. In the nearest neighbors algorithm, how should the number of
    neighbors be chosen?
