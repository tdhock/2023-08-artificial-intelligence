Halma (Adversarial Search)

Adapted from [[https://www.cefns.nau.edu/~edo/Classes/CS470-570_WWW/Assignments/Prog4-Gaming/Program4-Halma.html][Dr. D's Spring 2018 offering]].

** Overview: 

It's time to have some fun! And, of course, to get some more hands-on
experience with applied AI techniques. As you've noticed from the past
programming tasks, there's a huge difference between talking about
something theoretically in lecture and implementing a real piece of
"smart" software based on the concept! And yet it's creating a clever
piece of software that AI is all about...

For this project, we will implement a simple board game called
Halma. The fun twist will be that during the tournament at the end,
teams will run their Halma players head-to-head, with strict per-turn
time limits, to see who has the smartest program. Of course,
appropriate rewards will be given to the winner, as outlined below.

Let the games begin!

** The Problem:

Because our main aim is to focus on the concepts of adversarial search
and building *some* sort of smart game player, we want to choose a
game that is relatively simple: simple board, simple rules, simple
pieces, and simple piece movement. This will make encoding the basic
foundations straightforward and will let teams focus on fine-tuning
their gaming engines to make them as clever as possible. The simple
board game Halma meets these criteria perfectly: the board is a simple
square, there is only one kind of game piece, and movement rules are
the same for all pieces. And yet it should be complex enough to create
a reasonable-sized search space deep enough to reward finely-tuned
implementations.

You can read all about Halma on the wikipedia page:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halma. It's basically a game that was
invented at by a surgeon at Harvard Medical School in the late 1800s,
and has the distinction of being "the only truly American board game."
It is essentially a simplified version of Chinese Checkers, a
better-known update developed later on.

The concept is very simple: you have a square board and play
diagonally, from corner to corner. Each player starts with some pieces
in their corner known as their camp (or also yard), and the goal is to
get all of your pieces into the other person's camp. The main points
of the rules we'll observe are:

- The game is turn-taking. We'll flip a coin to see which player moves
  first, and there will be a time limit to make a move (e.g. 2
  seconds).
- The "standard" Halma board is 16x16 in size, but 8x8 and 10x10
  variations are common. Since this shouldn't really affect any code
  (if we do this right), we will technically allow different board
  sizes; you pass in the board size as you start a game.
- Pieces can move in any direction that free space exists, and may
  also jump other pieces. See details of legal moves on the wiki
  page. There is no obligation to jump, and jumps may end before
  making all possible jumps in the chain.
- Once pieces have entered the goal camp, they can never leave it;
  once they have left their own home area, they can't go back.
- There may be other rules or refinement tweaks that we add along the
  way, as needed based on evolving development and questions.

Although the Halma challenge is fairly simple as far as games go, it
will still take some substantial time and effort to get all the little
bits programmed and working right. To help people out a bit with their
planning, we'll outline the programming task into distinct overall
tasks, and we'll have some "proof-of-progress" milestones along the
way.

** The Assignment:

Your task, as indicated above, is to create a correct and (hopefully!)
skilled Halma playing agent. The agent will provide a graphical view
of the game board, as well as a basic two-player turn-taking
interface. Here is the basic use case:

- You open a terminal window on the gaming machine and invoke python
  on your game program, providing appropriate command-line parameters:
  - board_size: Board size: 8, 10, or 16
  - seconds_limit: Number of seconds allowed for each move. So that the
    algorithm can monitor its own time usage in order to present a
    move before the time limit runs out.
  - human_player: Which player you (the human) are: White or Black. Green
    always gets to move first.
  - optional: you could allow passing in the filename of a "board
    file" containing a particular board. This can be useful during
    development. If nothing is passed in, it sets up a starting board.
- A window with the graphical representation of the board pops up,
  with sides marked as Human and Computer, depending on who's playing
  what color. Like a chess board, the board is labeled with letters
  ('a' though 'h' ; or j or p, depending on board size) along the
  bottom (horizontal) edge, and numbers (1 through 8; or 10 or 16,
  depending on board size) along the vertical edge. This coordinate
  system is used to refer to board locations. The players' camps are
  in the top-left and bottom-right corners and, for the sake of
  uniformity for everyone, let's say that RED is always shown in the
  top-left, [[file:halma8x8-2.jpg][as on the graphic shown here]].
- Status output: There is a "status bar" above the board; this is just
  a text area where you can display messages from your program to show
  what's going on.
- Move input. Here you can choose what to provide. Basic: there is a
  "move entry" text area below the board. This appears/activates when
  it's the human's turn to enter a move. GUI I/O (extra points): You
  use clicking to move pieces, e.g., click the piece you want to move,
  then click the place to move it to.
- You start the game, and play proceeds by taking turns.
  - If it is your (human) turn, you are asked to enter a move, e.g.,
    text entry would be "a3->b4". If you input an illegal move, it
    tells you and you get to try again. When you enter a legal move,
    the specified piece is graphically moved and (a) your most
    recently-moved piece is highlighted in some way, plus (b) the
    square you moved from is highlighted in some small way (slight
    background color change, tiny pebble marker, whatever). This makes
    it easy to see where each player moved to most recently. This
    highlighting stays until the next move is made, at which point it
    updates. There is no time limit on the human move.
  - If it's the computer's turn, an "I'm thinking!" label appears in
    the status bar along with a timer counting down from the max. move
    limit time. When the computer stops thinking and makes a move, the
    same move highlighting techniques specified above are used for the
    computer's move. Make the move highlighting different colors for
    computer and human to keep things clear.
- When a player wins, the game ends, which is clearly announced in a
  dialog that also shows (a) number of move-cycles made (b) the final
  score for each player. The score is the number of pieces in the goal
  camp, plus (1/d) for each piece outside the camp, where d is the SLD
  distance between that piece and being somewhere in the home
  camp. This helps give credit for close games and almost winning.

** Timeline and organization:

To help organize, we will divide this program up into three weeks,
each of which has a list of things to get done. 

*** Basics Parts 0-1: Manual game playing framework

This creates the basic game playing framework that allows two humans
to play, but is missing an intelligent computer player. Has roughly
these main pieces:

- Graphical board object: responsible for putting up board window,
  drawing board, and placing pieces on board. Methods might include
  init (passing in some board), and update, in which you pass it a
  next board. It then displays the next board, including the move
  highlighting to mark what piece got moved. [[https://www.cefns.nau.edu/~edo/Classes/CS470-570_WWW/Assignments/Prog4-Gaming/PythonGraphics.html][Here are a couple of tech
  tips for doing simple graphics in Python]].
- Win/loss detector. This is just a function (method of board object)
  that takes in a game board and reports whether somebody won. This is
  actually fairly easy: you just need to see if red/green has gotten
  all their pieces into the opposite camp.
- Move generator, v1: You'll need a fast accurate move generator, so
  you'll want to get that done right away. Ultimately, you'll want to
  tune this module to the max, because it gets called **a lot** by
  your smart agent in the next phase. For now, just concentrate on
  getting a method that, given a board and whose turn it is to move
  (red/green), returns all possible legal moves that player could
  make. Don't forget to have it look for jumps...that's the tricky
  part!
- A "move" method. Takes in a current board and a move, and returns
  either a new board after making the move, or an error of some sort
  to indicate that the move is illegal. The computer player can, of
  course, avoid even generating illegal moves (in the move
  generator). But you also need to make sure the human player doesn't
  enter illegal moves! This is easy: you just have your move generator
  (which only generates legal next moves) generate all possible next
  moves for the human. Then just check that the move that the human
  just entered is in that list!
- Main Game object: This is the main object that runs the game
  overall. It generates the starting board, calls the board object to
  set up the graphical display, handles turn-taking mechanics
  including user input (including detecting illegal moves (which is
  easy, just use your move generator!)), keeps the time, and prints
  out various status messages in the status bar. It also includes
  miscellaneous pieces like reporting a winner when that
  happens....including related stats (number of moves, jump moves made
  by each player, etc).

Milestone: when done with the basics stage, you should have a
functioning game management system for two *human* players: It
presents the game and then asks each player in turn for their move,
moving pieces accordingly, reporting illegal moves, and reporting wins
and scores.

*** Brains, part 2: Creating your Halma agent

Now add a "computer player" by creating a smart Halma playing
agent. Assuming that you have the basics in place, including a
well-functioning moves generator, this part should be fairly
straightforward. The main pieces are:

- You need to create your "player" object that gets created as the
  game starts, passing it the move time limit, which player (red or
  green) it is, and anything else you need to configure it.
- Minimax search. The main method you'll want to create is
  "make-a-move", which will just take in a game board (i.e. the
  current board that you're supposed to move from), and will then
  search down the game tree using minimax search with alpha-beta
  pruning to return a next move. As you'll recall (review Ch5!) this
  is essentially just a depth-limited DFS search, with MIN and MAX
  alternating at each level. It might be useful to return a move as an
  object: not just the move itself, but also some useful stats on how
  the search for it went: number of boards examined, depth of ply
  finished, value of starting board and board reached by move.
- Alpha-beta pruning. This is really an add-on to your Minimax search
  engine, as discussed in Ch5, allowing it to prune off whole
  sub-trees of the search space. Which has no effect on the ultimate
  outcome of the search, but will save tons of time...which will allow
  your program to search further ahead while staying in the time
  limit...which will help you WIN! If you return a move object (see
  last point), then you can easily add some alpha-beta stats to it to
  help visualize function, e.g., how many prunes and at what level/ply
  they occurred.
- Utility function. This is basically a more subtle version of the
  "win detector" from phase1. This function "scores" a board based on
  its "goodness". What exactly it looks like to do this is part of the
  magic you'll want to build into your solution! The most basic
  version might just add up the distance that each piece is from being
  in the "goal camp" (lower scores are best). More sophisticated
  versions will look at whether you are setting yourself or (your
  opponent!) up for fast-forward jumping moves.

Just getting your player up and playing legal Halma is only the first
step, of course. If you want to WIN the tournament, you'll want to
leave plenty of time for refining and fine-tuning your player. Your
basic goal here would be to streamline every aspect of the code
related to exploring downward in the game tree so that you can fully
search as many plies as possible within the time limit. This might
mean streamlining often-called functions like the move generator and
utility function, but perhaps also exploring other more
efficient/compact board representations.

Ultimately, you need to stay within the time limit, so you'll want to
test enough to know how long it takes your program, maximally, to
search one ply, two plies, three plies, etc etc. That way, when the
game starts and the time limit is given, you can tell your program to
search to some ply that you *know* is well within that limit, and
return a move...then use any remaining time to have it try to tackle
the next ply. If time runs out, you can return the move you have; if
you can finish another ply, you have an even better move to return!

** The Tournament. Finding out who has the most artificial intelligence chops...

This project is the Final Project for the course, and thus is due at
the designated time for the final exam. During this time, we will hold
a tournament. We can negotiate some details as the time approaches,
but the basic plan is to meet in the classroom, establish a playoff
bracket, and have a series of head-to-head matches to determine who is
the Halma champion. It will go like this:

[[file:halma8x8.jpg]]

- The tournament will be played using an 8x8 board, 10 pieces each,
  with starting position as shown above.
- Each person must bring one laptop that has a functioning
  version of Python3.10 installed.
- Two teams that are playing each other will choose a laptop to play
  on; both programs get loaded onto that laptop so that there are no
  hardware advantages. The two Halma players are started on the
  laptop, one with a red human player, one with a green human player.
- The green player goes first: that player's Halma agent 
  then generates a move. That move is entered manually by the
  observing humans into the other running program as "the human's
  move"; that agent then generates a responding move; which is then
  entered back into the other program. And so on.
- All Halma agents must be quiescent after generating a move. That is,
  they must generate a move, then prompt for the human player's next
  move...and then block, waiting for that move to be
  entered. Specifically: no multi-threading and burning resources in
  the background!
- If an erroneous move is detected, or some other error/crash happens,
  then the program that has crashed/errored forfeits the match. If the
  error was a fluke and time is still left in the round, the match
  should be restarted if possible, to allow the losing team a chance
  to prove that their player mostly works.

Dr. H will act as referree, and will be circulating around, scoring
the different programs as play progresses. The final round will be
played on the class video screens, and bets will be taken!

There are always small details and questions that will arise that are
not addressed here, but we can resolve these quickly as we go
along. Here are rules for a few detailed situations that have come up
in the past:

- No "input area" is required if you provide an elegant and effective
  direct-manipulation (e.g. clicking on board) way to enter
  moves. Still must highlight most recent move as specified above.
- No null moves: Handles the perverse situation of whether you can do
  a jump...and on the second hop, jump back to where you started. The
  answer is "no". In other words: legal moves will always land you
  somewhere other than at your starting point.
- Wins by time-out: It is possible that (for whatever reason) a game
  will not complete within a set amount of time. If a game is
  terminated prematurely, the winner is the player who, at that
  moment, has the best score, as calculated by the metric suggested
  under "utility function", i.e., sum of shortest straight-line
  distances of all piece to the goal area. Uses Pythagorean in
  simplest way: SQRT(SQR(row-diff) + SQR(col-diff)) where your target
  is the nearest square inside the goal area. You should print this
  score in your display area as a running total, re-calc'd after every
  move you make.
- Move times. We are sticking with what was originally specified:
  allowed time/move will be decided in each round, and entered as a
  param when launching the players. The move time may be different for
  each round/game, so your players should adapt smoothly to different
  limits, i.e., always return a move in the limit, but utilize all
  time available. We might minor "overage" on move time once or two,
  but you'll forfeit if you go over limit frequently.
- Blocking: Blocking is when a player leaves pieces in their home area
  late into the game, which of course could prevent ("block") the
  opponent from getting their pieces into the opposing home area to
  win. We decided to handle this in a simple fashion, no complex
  programming required: At the end of the game, if there are pieces in
  the home area blocking an otherwise possible win, we will simply
  declare a win. So: if you *could* win if it were not for the
  blocking, then you win.
 
** Scoring for this project

Scoring for this project will be similar to that for previous project
(effort invested, performance on tests/tournament, quality of
code). There are three basic deliverables for this project (Parts
0-2). The deliverables will describe the nature and extent of your
implementation. The tournament provides the proof of what you
state in your write-ups.

** Project Deadlines and Deliverables:

As outlined above, the project is divided into three parts to help
make sure you are moving along, and stay on track to produce a good
product on time at the end. Each part requires a PDF uploaded to
bblearn; the details and deadlines are as follows. (note that the
instructions above are suggestions but the statements below about what
goes in the PDF are requirements)

*** Part 0 Deliverable: GUI and moves for one player

- Overview. A brief description of how you chose to architect your
  code: overview of the key objects/classes and their key methods.
- Display NxN grid, [[https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/grid.html][using the grid manager]]. Each cell can be a
  Tkinter.Canvas. Use N=8 for screenshots in part 0.
- Screenshot of initial board: white or black circles in one corner,
  representing the pieces for one player. (use [[https://tkinter-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/widgets/canvas.html#Canvas.create_oval][canvas.create_oval]])
- Screenshots of possible moves after clicking on a piece. Clicking on
  a circle should hilight that piece, and make squares appear,
  representing where moves are possible for that piece. (use
  canvas.create_rectangle)
- Screenshots after having moved some pieces. Clicking on a square
  should move the hilighted piece (delete the old oval, and draw a new
  one). You can erase/remove circles and squares via
  canvas.delete(id).
- Screenshot of moves available from several consecutive jumps. Start
  by implementing moves to adjacent squares. After that is working,
  implement the jumping.
- Extra Credit: arrange the pieces as shown in the figure below, and
  then click on the right piece, and take a screenshot of the possible
  moves, that shows that your program agrees with that figure (from
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halma][wikipedia]]).

[[file:Halma_rules.png]]

Please submit a PDF with your code, along with labeled and annotated
screenshots that very clearly demonstrate each of the above.

*** Part 1 Deliverable: game for two humans

- Functionality checklist. This documents precisely the functionality
  that you completed for this phase. Hopefully, this is just a series
  of "100% working" checkmarks. Make this a table as well, with three
  columns: Functionality, %complete, notes. Here are the items in the
  "Functionality" column:
  - Graphical board display: Generates nicely-formatted GUI for your
    system, including the board, plus status (score+win).
  - Board updating: GUI can receive updates to the board, display them
    smoothly, and includes move highlighting to chose from/to places
    of last-moved piece.
  - Move generator: Given a board and which player to move, it
    produces a correct and complete list of possible next moves,
    including jumps.
  - Win detector: display a message when one player wins.
  - Any extra/additional functionality that you innovated and think is
    worth highlighting.
- Demos: Clearly labeled and annotated screenshots that very clearly
  demonstrated each of the above. 

Suggestions/hints: my solution has two classes, with the following methods:
- Position: create_oval, update_distance_to_goal, create_shape,
  delete_shape, click_oval, click_rectangle, move_positions, jump,
  adjacent_positions, get_position_for_xy_offset.
- Board: next_turn, hilite_turn, delete_moves. With useful data
  attributes for keeping track of which positions have pieces/moves
  drawn: piece_dict (indexed by xy position), move_list. And current total scores for each
  player (total_distance_to_goal, lower is better).

*** Part 2 deliverable: game for human and AI

- Overview: Similar to part1, but now extended to focus on the
  creation of your intelligent Halma agent. Condense your description
  of the basics from Part1 (labeling them as "Part1" pieces), but
  leave them in so as to give a complete picture. Then add in
  (labeling as Part1) what objects/classes you added to upgrade your
  program into an intelligent system for playing Halma. Be sure to
  discuss the design of your utility function, i.e., what metrics it
  uses to determine the "goodness" of a board.
- Functionality Checklist. Just as for Part1, but now has the
  following items for the Functionality column:
  - Utility function. Have a fully-functional utility function that,
    given a board, return some non-trivial (i.e. actually useful)
    measure of how strong that board is.
  - Minimax search. Is able to take a board, which player is moving,
    and some indication of how much to search (either #plies directly,
    or the time it has to move), and will return a move. At very
    least, it returns a legal move to make each and every time. At
    best, it returns a really *good* move to make!
  - Alpha-beta pruning. Can be turned on or off (for testing purposes)
    in your call to minimax search. Implements the alpha-beta
    algorithm correctly. Has some way of reporting the pruning events,
    so that you can effectively debug/demo its efficacy.
  - Any extra/additional functionality that you think is worth
    highlighting.
- Demos: Same thing as before, but focus it on your "intelligent"
  pieces. Some specifics to show would be:
  - Your unit testing for minimax: show some board, then start minimax
    on that board with some time limit, then show the resulting move
    plus all the stats: how many plies you went down, how many boards
    where generated/examined, and time taken.
  - Your alpha-beta being awesome. Using the same board as above, now
    show your minimax running with alpha-beta turned ON. One would
    hope to see the stats improve (more boards within same time...or
    less time for same number of boards), plus some indication of how
    many pruning events happened and on what ply/level.
- Performance tuning your project, to try to get it running as fast as
  possible for the tournament.
- Hint: you could create a method make_best_move_if_AI() and call it
  at the end of next_turn(). It should make a list of possible
  children/successor boards to search with minimax/alpha-beta.
- Please submit a PDF with your code and results/screenshots as
  described above.

The detailed scoring for part 2 will, of course, be left up to your
professor, but the basic outline goes like this:

- 0-60% -- fully-functional *manual* version of a Halma
  playing program.
- 60-100% -- fully-functional Halma agent, that is, a
  program with smart computer player. Detailed points depend on level
  of smartness, as described in write-up and demonstrated in
  tournament.
- Extra credit points will be given as premiums in the tournament.
