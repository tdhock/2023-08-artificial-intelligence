Homework 1: getting started with python.

The goal of this homework is to demonstrate you have basic python
programming skills.

1. Create a function =file_to_list_of_ints(filename)= which reads a
   text file, and converts each item in that file to an integer, and
   returns the resulting numbers in a list.

2. Create a function =product(list_of_ints)= which computes the
   product of all elements of the list (multiply all elements
   together).

3. Use the two functions to compute the product of the numbers in
   [[file:01_data.txt]]. 

4. Also have your program print the number of items in the list.

5. Take a screenshot of your emacs window, split in two, after having
   run the code line by line using C-RET. Top window should be your
   python script file (hw1.py), bottom window should be the python
   console with prompt (>>>) and output after running your code.

Make sure to submit your results as a single PDF file with your
screenshot, code and corresponding output when you run it through the
python interpreter.
